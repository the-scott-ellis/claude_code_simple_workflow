# Completed Features

This directory contains archived completed features.

## About This Example

The example file here (`add-member-modal.md`) demonstrates how to document completed work:
- What was built
- Implementation details
- Key decisions made
- Files created/modified
- Session summaries

## Using in Your Project

When you complete a feature using `/finish feature-name`, it gets moved here from the `features/` directory.

Archive naming convention:
- Include the year-month for easy sorting: `2025-01-feature-name.md`
- Or just use the feature name: `feature-name.md`

## Why Archive Completed Work?

- **Historical record** - Remember what you built and why
- **Learning** - Reference past decisions
- **Onboarding** - New team members can see project evolution
- **Clean workspace** - Active features directory stays focused
